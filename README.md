# API Testing & Documentation

This repository contains Postman tests and Swagger documentation for practicing REST API testing and documentation workflows using public or mock APIs.

## Structure

- `/postman/` – Contains Postman collections for API testing with test scripts.
- `/swagger/` –  Contains Swagger API documentation.
- `/environments/` - Contains environment configuration files for Postman.
- `/newman-reports/` – Contains Newman HTML test reports generated from Postman collections.
- `/data/` - This folder contains mock data used to simulate a RESTful API for testing and documentation purposes.

# How to Run json-server From the data folder

## Prerequisites

##  How to Use Newman Reporter

###  Install Dependencies

Before running tests with HTML reporting, install the required tools globally:

```bash
npm install -g newman
npm install -g newman-reporter-htmlextra
newman -v
```

---

###  Run the Tests with Report

To generate a Newman HTML report using the `htmlextra` reporter:

```bash
newman run <collection-file>.json -r htmlextra
```

- `-e` – Specify the environment file
- `-r cli,htmlextra` – Run CLI output + HTML report
- `--reporter-htmlextra-export` – Export the HTML file to `/newman/`

---

###  View the Report

1. Navigate to the `/newman/` folder
2. Open `report.html` in any browser to view the detailed test results

  ##  How to Use Postman Environment

###  Import the Environment

1. Go to Postman → (Settings) → **Environments**
2. Click **Import**
3. Select the file: `environment file` from `/environments/`

###  Select the Environment

- Choose the imported environment from the **Environment dropdown** in the top-right corner of the Postman app

###  Use Variables in Requests

Instead of hardcoding values, use environment variables in your requests.  
For example:

```http
GET {{baseUrl}}/orders/{{order_id}}
```

##  How to Use Swagger

  Clone the repo: https://github.com/juba97/postman-swagger.git

1. **Go to Swagger Petstore UI**:
   - Visit the following URL: [Swagger Petstore UI](https://petstore.swagger.io)

2. **Insert the Raw URL of the OpenAPI YAML file**:
   - In the "Explore" field, paste the Raw URL of the `openapi.yaml` file.
     - Example: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/your-username/your-repository/main/openapi.yaml`

3. **Click the "Explore" button**:
   - This will load the API documentation, and you will be able to interact with the API endpoints directly from the UI.

4. **Explore the API**:
   - You can now test the API methods, view the responses, and explore the parameters.
